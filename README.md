COVID app for Hack Schulich

Using available Ontario COVID-19 data, we give users a calculated risk score based on where they would like to go.

We take into account factors such as age, sex, location, and exposure.

This git repository stores the Python venv and Django REST API that stores user and COVID data and performs calculations.

The front end is a mobile application (currently on iOS) and coded in Flutter/Dart. The application files can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wn2cG_2jy_KmhK0-xzje6ECb2nn5ti_k/view?usp=sharing.
